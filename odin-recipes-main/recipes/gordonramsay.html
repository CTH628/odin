    <h2 class="header">Ingredients</h2>

    Makes 15-20 brownies
    
    <ul>
        <li>245g dark chocolate, broken into squares or roughly chopped</li>
        <li>200g butter, diced, plus extra for greasing</li>
        <li>175g caster sugar</li>
        <li>125g light soft brown sugar</li>
        <li>4 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>115g plain flour</li>
        <li>Pinch of sea salt</li>
        <li>100g dark chocolate, chopped into small chunks (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="header">Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C/160°C fan/Gas 4. Grease and line a 30 x 23cm
            cake tin with baking parchment.</li>
        <li>Put the chocolate and butter into a large heatproof bowl set over a pan
            of gently simmering water (don't let the bottom of the bowl touch the
            water underneath) and leave until melted, stirring occasionally (see Tips)</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and cool the chocolate down by whisking in the
            sugars using a balloon whisk. Add the eggs and vanilla extract and mix
            in with a wooden spoon until combined. Sift over the flour and salt and
            stir again until smooth and combined. Pour into the prepared tin,
            smoothing the top level. </li>
        <li>Bake for 35-40 minutes, until cracked around the edges and soft in
            the middle (it will firm up as it cools), rotating the tin halfway
            through baking. </li>
        <li>If you are adding the chocolate chunks, take the brownie out of the
            oven after 20 minutes and vigorously throw the chunks of chocolate at
            the half-baked brownie so they break the surface. Return to the oven
            for the remaining cooking time. </li>
        <li>Transfer the brownie to a wire rack and leave it to cool in the tin,
            then cut into squares before serving. Once cooled, the brownies will
            keep in an airtight container for up to a week. Alternatively,
            cool the cooked brownie in the tin for 10 minutes, then cut into squares
            and serve warm with a dollop of thick cream.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 class="header">Tip</h3>

    <p>If you prefer, put the chocolate and butter into a heatproof bowl,
        cover (leaving a small air gap) and melt in the microwave on high
        for about 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. These brownies also freeze
        well for up to a month. Simply wrap them tightly in cling film and freeze,
        then thaw at a cool room temperature before serving.</p>
