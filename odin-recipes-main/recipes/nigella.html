    <h2 class="header">Description</h2>

    <p>I don't know why people don't make Birthday Brownies all the time —
        they're so easy and so wonderful. Brownies are much quicker to make
        than a cake, and they look so beautiful piled up in a rough-and-tumble
        pyramid spiked with birthday candles.</p>

    <h2 class="header">Ingredients</h2>

    Makes: maximum of 48
    
    <ul>
        <li>375 grams soft unsalted butter</li>
        <li>375 grams best-quality dark chocolate</li>
        <li>6 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>500 grams caster sugar</li>
        <li>225 grams plain flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>300 grams chopped walnuts</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="header">Steps</h2>

    You will need a tin measuring approximately 33 x 23 x 5.5cm / 13 x 9 x 2.25 inches

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C/160°C Fan/350°F/gas mark 4.
            Line your brownie pan — I think it's worth lining the sides as well
            as the base — with foil, parchment or Bake-O-Glide.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter and chocolate together in a large heavy-based pan.In a
            bowl or large wide-mouthed measuring jug, beat the eggs with the sugar
            and vanilla. Measure the flour into another bowl and add the salt.</li>
        <li>When the chocolate mixture has melted, let it cool a bit before beating
            in the eggs and sugar, and then the nuts and flour. Beat to combine
            smoothly and then scrape out of the saucepan into the lined pan.</li>
        <li>Bake for about 25 minutes. When it's ready, the top should be dried to
            a paler brown speckle, but the middle still dark and dense and gooey.
            And even with such a big batch you do need to keep alert, keep checking:
            the difference between gungy brownies and dry brownies is only a few
            minutes; remember that they will continue to cook as they cool.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 class="header">Tip</h3>

    <p>You can really vary brownies as you wish: get rid of the walnuts,
        or halve them and make up their full weight with dried cherries;
        or replace them with other nuts — peanuts, brazils, hazelnuts — add
        shredded coconut or white chocolate chips or buttons; try stirring in
        some Jordan's Original Crunchy cereal. I had high hopes for chic,
        after-dinner pistachio-studded brownies, but found the nuts get too soft
        and waxy, when what you need is a little crunchy contrast.</p>
